test pre-requisites

pre-requisites are things that are supposed to have been in place before starting any kind of testing. For selenium webdriver testing, pre-requisites are;

One have to download the language to use in writing the code test scripts in mine own case I use Java
Then the environment that will be use to write the code, here I used Eclipse IDE
The next thing is to download all the needed jar file like selenium standalone, webdriver for the browswer to be use in automation and others
then open IDE, set the system property for the webdriver path and import all external jar files
Now one can start writing the test script for the functionality testing on the Url to be tested
To do the above step, will open te url manually and inspect the web page to check for web element locator.

assumptions made and issues found
For each side bar like input form, alert and listbox. The location couldn't click on any them, I had to pass through each with the Url of each page on each browser which wss why I was able to continuing the testing.
